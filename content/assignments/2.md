# Intro to Infrastructure-as-Code

In Assignment 1, you manually set up a basic web server and web page on an EC2 instance. However, such a configuration isn't optimal for a production system because there is no redundancy and all extra capacity must be added manually.

In this assignment, you'll learn to deploy a web app in a robust, well-architected, and scalable way, using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to provide a single, reproducible source of ground truth for your cloud resources.

## Yoctogram

Through the rest of the quarter, our deployments will involve Yoctogram, a minimal image-sharing app we built for you. The backend is written in Python, using the FastAPI web framework and SQLAlchemy to interface with a database. The frontend is written in ReactJS.

![The Yoctogram user interface](/assignments/2/yoctogram-ui.png)

Yoctogram's functionality is limited: it allows you to upload images that are designated public (visible to everyone) or private (visible to only yourself), view others' public images, and view a feed of images ordered by recency.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Before moving on, take a moment to click around our reference deployment, available at https://yoctogram.akps.infracourse.cloud.

### Cloud services

Despite the application logic being intentionally simplistic, Yoctogram still relies on a number of key cloud constructs.

This diagram depicts the deployed cloud resources that Yoctogram uses.

![](/assignments/2/yoctogram-arch.png)

We can categorize the resources we need as follows:

1. **Compute resources**: where does the app run?
   - On Docker containers, where AWS manages the scaling through _Elastic Container Service_ (ECS). AWS also manages the scaling through _Fargate_.
   - An _Application Load Balancer_ (ALB) will be used to handle incoming API requests and assign them to a target container for processing.
   - The app's frontend will be deployed to an _Simple Storage Service_ (S3) bucket and served to users via _Cloudfront_, a _content delivery network_ (CDN) that caches content closer to the user, making downloads faster and cheaper.
2. **Data resources**: where does the app store data?
   - User information and image metadata is stored on a _Postgres_ database available through _Aurora Serverless_, where AWS manages the database cluster and exposes an endpoint for the app to connect to it.
   - The images themselves are stored in S3.
   - When users visit Yoctogram, images are rendered through Cloudfront.
3. **Networking resources**: supporting compute and data resources
   - The ECS cluster and Aurora Postgres databases need to be provisioned within subnets of a _Virtual Private Cloud_ (VPC).
   - The ECS app cluster will live in a subnet assigned private IP addresses but with outbound internet access through a NAT gateway.
   - The database cluster will live in a private subnet with no outbound network access, only accessible to the app cluster through internal networking.
   - To make your app easy to access, your frontend will be assigned the domain `yoctogram.SUNET.infracourse.cloud` through _Route 53_.
   - To provide HTTPS encryption in transit, we'll use the _Amazon Certificate Manager_ to assign your load balancer and frontend distributions a _Transport Layer Security_ (TLS) certificate.

## Getting started

First, log in to your AWS console and deposit the credit code we give you in your account. Check Ed for details on how to do so.

### Setting up a development EC2 VM

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
We strongly recommend following the below setup steps to set up a development environment on an EC2 virtual machine. It is possible to complete the assigment working from a local machine, but we can't guarantee the dependencies that various parts of Assignment 2 rely on (namely, `pip`, NPM, Docker, AWS CLI, AWS CDK) will work on your local machine.
{{< /callout >}}

1.  Navigate back to the EC2 dashboard and select _Launch Instance_. You can name the instance anything.

    ![Screenshot indicating the Launch Instances button](/assignments/1/launch_instance.jpg "Screenshot indicating the Launch Instances button")

2.  Click on the "Browse more AMIs" button.

    ![Screenshot indicating the Browse more AMIs button](/assignments/2/community-ami.png)

3.  Click on the "Community AMIs" tab, then search for `ami-02ffb1f43e49576e5`. This will give you a VM image with all the tools needed to complete this assignment.

    ![Screenshot indicating the Assignment 2 AMI](/assignments/2/cs40_a2_ami.png)

4.  Use the following settings:

    - `t4g.medium` instance type
    - Use the keypair you created in Assignment 1
    - Create a new security group (firewall). Allow SSH traffic inbound (port 22).
    - 20 GB of storage

    Make sure you are using `t4g.medium` as a larger instance type will increase costs.

5.  Expand the "Advanced Details" dropdown and click "Create new IAM profile". This should open a new tab displaying the Identity and Access Management (IAM) console.

    ![](/assignments/2/ec2-iam-profile-create.png)

6.  On the top right, click the orange "Create Role" button. Keep the "Trusted entity type" selection as "AWS service" (which should be default), and then select "EC2" from the dropdown. Keep the default "EC2" radio button checked. Click "Next".

    ![Page 1 of IAM role configuration](/assignments/2/iam-role-1.png)

7.  Search for the `AdministratorAccess` permission policy and select it. This policy creates permissions to manage non-user resources in your AWS account.

    ![Page 2 of IAM role configuration](/assignments/2/iam-administratoraccess.png)

8.  Click "Next". You can name your role anything; we suggest something like `CS40Assignment2`.

9.  Go back to the EC2 instance creation wizard tab. Click the refresh button next to "IAM instance profile" and select your newly created role.

    ![Selected IAM role for EC2 instance](/assignments/2/ec2-selected-iam-role.png)

10. Launch your instance. Confirm that the launch was successful and the instance is running.

11. Make a note of the instance's IP address, which you'll use to SSH into the VM as user `root` (e.g., `ssh root@34.212.146.53`).

12. Once SSHed, run the command `aws sts get-caller-identity` to ensure that your EC2 instance has the proper permissions to complete the assignment. The output should look something like the following.

    ![Running `aws sts get-caller-identity` on the EC2 instance](/assignments/2/ec2-role-working.png)

13. If you're working with another student, add your partner's SSH **public** key so that they can log in. This will look something like

    ```
    echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lREDACTEDAAAAIPmXTFC3B4caraPBBenjtyi7Hqs8REDACTEDVQAEyOU aditya@saligrama.io" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

    {{< callout type="warning" >}}Ensure you use `>>` and not `>`, as the latter will overwrite your own public key, potentially locking you out of your VM.{{< /callout >}}

14. To work with code that resides on your EC2 development VM, you can follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) to connect Visual Studio Code to your VM over SSH.

### Starter code

First, log into GitHub and click "Import repository".

![](/assignments/2/github-import.png)

Use `https://github.com/infracourse/assignment2` for "Your old repository's clone URL". You can name the new repository anything under your personal account; we suggest something like `cs40-assignment2`.

Make sure to keep the repository private. If you're working with a partner, make sure to add them as a collaborator in Settings.

On your EC2 instance, clone the Assignment 2 starter code into your working directory: `git clone --recursive git@github.com:yourusername/cs40-assignment2 assignment2`.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
You might need to add your SSH key to GitHub to make sure this clone step (as well as subsequent pushes to GitHub) will work; follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) on how to do so.

Note that you don't necessarily need to generate a new keypair within your EC2 instance; just using agent forwarding (e.g., `ssh -A root@34.212.146.53`) should work as long as you add the keypair from Assignment 1 to GitHub.
{{< /callout >}}

Add our upstream repository as a secondary origin in your locally cloned Git repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:infracourse/assignment2
```

If we need to update the starter code after assignment release, you can pull the updated code by running:

```bash
git pull --rebase upstream main
```

As you work, you can push commits to your individual repository by runnign:

```bash
git push origin main
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
You won't need to modify any of the application code in the `app` (backend) or `web` (frontend) submodule directories, but it doesn't hurt yourself to familiarize yourself with this code. In particular, you might want to take a look at how we create presigned Cloudfront download links for image rendering and presigned S3 upload links. This is in the file `app/app/ext/s3.py`.
{{< /callout >}}

### Validating code while you work

You should test your code as you work. AWS CDK allows you to synthesize resources without deploying them. To do so, simply run `cdk synth`. This should give you ideas of what to fix if you see errors.

To ensure you're defining your resources correctly as you work through the assignment, we've included some [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) rules that validate your code (these rules also form the basis of this assignment's autograder).

To validate your code, simply run `./grade.sh` from your `assignment2` directory. We strongly recommend testing your code locally this way before deploying to AWS.

## The AWS Cloud Development Kit

AWS's Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an infrastructure-as-code technology that lets the developer define cloud resources using familiar programming languages (in our case, Python). CDK is a layer of abstraction over _AWS CloudFormation_, which is a way to declare cloud resources using configuration formats such as JSON or YAML.

CDK's basic unit of deployment is called a _stack_. Each stack encloses a number of AWS resources that are all deployed together. In the starter code, we've defined four stacks for you based on the above categorization: `DnsStack`, `NetworkStack`, `DataStack`, and `ComputeStack`. Take a look at the starter code to see some examples of resource declarations.

In particular, observe that resources in `ComputeStack` depend on those in the other three stacks, and that resources in `DataStack` also depend on resources in `NetworkStack` and `DnsStack`.

To help share resource information across stacks, we've defined for you in `cdk/cdk/util.py` a `Props` object that contains references to each CDK resource that will need to be referenced from another stack. Take a read through the starter code to see how to use this.

{{% details title="More about CDK (review from 1/31's IaC lecture)" closed="true" %}}
Generally, cloud infrastructure-as-code frameworks are _declarative_, rather than _imperative_, programming models. In other words, you express the desired end state of the infrastructure (e.g., "create an EC2 VM instance of type `t4g.small`") but without specifying the steps to reach that state. CloudFormation is an example of a declarative IaC framework, as is Terraform.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
In this assignment, you'll be writing CDK code in Python. This allows you to add control flow, looping, and arbitrary additional computation to your code. We recommend against doing so, as it complicates state management, and encourage you to only call CDK constructors in each stack.
{{< /callout >}}

For example, to define the aforementioned EC2 instance, you would use the following CDK code:

```python
from aws_cdk import (
    Stack,
    aws_ec2 as ec2
)

# Boilerplate: each resource instantiation needs to go in a Stack's constructor.
class ExampleStack(Stack):
    def __init__(
        self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs
    ) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        # The actual instance declaration.
        instance = ec2.Instance(
            self,
            "example-ec2-instance",
            instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t4g.small"),
            machine_image=ec2.MachineImage.latest_amazon_linux(
                cpu_type=ec2.AmazonLinuxCpuType.ARM_64
            ),
            vpc=ec2.Vpc.from_lookup(self, "VPC", is_default=True)
        )
```

Note that simply calling the `ec2.Instance` constructor will create the instance -- we don't necessarily need to save the instantiation to a variable. However, one powerful aspect of CDK is the ability to cross-reference a previously declared resource during the instantiation of a new resource.

For example, suppose we wanted to associate a DNS record (domain name) with the newly created EC2 instance using Route 53. This requires knowing the public IP address of the EC2 instance! We do this as follows:

```python
from aws_cdk import (
    Stack,
    aws_ec2 as ec2,
    aws_route53 as r53
)

class ExampleStack(Stack):
    def __init__(
        self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs
    ) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        # Import the existing Hosted Zone created earlier.
        hosted_zone = r53.HostedZone.from_lookup(
            self, "EXAMPLE_ZONE_ID", domain_name="example.infracourse.cloud"
        )

        instance = ec2.Instance(
            self,
            "example-ec2-instance",
            instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t4g.small"),
            machine_image=ec2.MachineImage.latest_amazon_linux(
                cpu_type=ec2.AmazonLinuxCpuType.ARM_64
            ),
            vpc=ec2.Vpc.from_lookup(self, "VPC", is_default=True)
        )

        # Create a DNS record `a2-example.example.infracourse.cloud`
        # pointing at the EC2 instance's public IP address.
        dns_record = r53.ARecord(
            self,
            zone=hosted_zone,
            record_name="a2-example",
            target=r53.RecordTarget.from_ip_addresses(
                instance.instance_public_ip
            )
        )
```

{{% /details %}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}
AWS CDK provides _many_ modules defining _many_ resource types. To more easily keep track of the types that need to be provided to each type constructor, we strongly suggest you use a code editor with good support for Python 3 type hinting. Visual Studio Code works well for this purpose.
{{< /callout >}}

## Defining resources in CDK

As you've observed, our starter code defines some CDK resources for you, but we've left you a number of comments where you need to define the remainder of the resources to complete the Yoctogram deployment.

Before you proceed, take a look at the `Settings` class in `cdk/cdk/util.py` and take stock of the variables we've defined that you can use in your CDK code to centralize environment specifics.

Additionally, the [CDK Python API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/) will be very helpful for the rest of the assignment.

### Setting environment specifics

Although much of the CDK code is generalizable across deployment instances, some of it still needs to be customized for your own particular deployment.

In the `cdk` directory, create a file called `.env`. Paste the following into it:

```bash
SUNET=SUNETID
CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=yourawsaccountid
```

substituting `SUNETID` with your SUNet ID and `CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` with your 12-digit AWS account ID.

### Network Stack

This section will focus on filling out resources in `cdk/cdk/network_stack.py`.

#### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

We've given you a shell Virtual Private Cloud (type `ec2.Vpc`), where our compute and database resources will live. Add the following specifications:

- Two availability zones: `us-west-2a` and `us-west-2b`
- The VPC's IP address space should be `10.0.0.0/16`
- Three subnets, each within a CIDR `/24`, of the following types:
  - Public
  - Private with outbound (egress) internet access via a NAT gateway
  - Private and isolated (no egress internet access)

#### TLS Certificate

We've given you a shell Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate (type `acm.Certificate`), which allows us to enable HTTPS for the Yoctogram frontend and backend. Add the following specifications:

- Domain name: `SUNETID.infracourse.cloud`
- Subject alternative names:
  - `*.SUNETID.infracourse.cloud`
  - `*.yoctogram.SUNETID.infracourse.cloud`
- Validation via DNS from the provisioned Hosted Zone (`props.network_hosted_zone`)

### Data Stack

This section will focus on filling out resources in `cdk/cdk/data_stack.py`.

#### Aurora Serverless Database

We've given you a shell Relational Database Service (RDS) Aurora Serverless Cluster (type `rds.ServerlessCluster`), which defines the primary Postgres-based database where user and image records will be stored. Add the following specifications:

- Postgres engine version 13.10
- Hosted in the VPC you created earlier, in the private, isolated (no egress) subnets
- Database name `yoctogram`
- Database credentials generated for you within Secrets Manager
  - Exclude special characters from the credentials (conveniently, this string is defined for you as `settings.DB_SPECIAL_CHARS_EXCLUDE`)

### Compute Stack

This section will focus on filling out resources in `cdk/cdk/compute_stack.py`.

#### Fargate task definition

We've given you a shell ECS Fargate Task Definition (type `ecs.FargateTaskDefinition`), which provides the runtime configuration for the Yoctogram backend container. Add the following specifications:

- 512 CPU units
- 2 GB of RAM
- Linux operating system
- ARM64 architecture

To ensure that the container can access needed resources, grant the task role for the task definition access to the database and signing key secrets, as well as the private and public images S3 buckets.

#### Fargate container definition

To your Fargate task definition, add a container with the following specifications:

- Container image: derive from the Yoctogram backend source code in the `app` directory
- Expose port 80 (HTTP/TCP) on the container
- The following environment variables should be injected into the container, for configuration:
  - key `PRODUCTION`, value `true`
  - key `DEBUG`, value `false`
  - key `FORWARD_FACING_NAME`, value `yoctogram.SUNETID.infracourse.cloud`
  - key `PUBLIC_IMAGES_BUCKET`, value as the bucket name for your previously created public images S3 bucket
  - key `PRIVATE_IMAGES_BUCKET`, value as the bucket name for your previously created private images S3 bucket
  - key `PUBLIC_IMAGES_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION`, value as the URL for the Cloudfront distribution for public images (`props.data_cloudfront_public_images`)
  - key `PRIVATE_IMAGES_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION`, value as the URL for the Cloudfront distribution for private images (`props.data_cloudfront_private_images`)
- Your generated database secrets should be injected into the container. These are stored in Secrets Manager as a JSON key-value structure. To make this simpler, we've provided the keys as an array in `settings.DB_SECRET_MAPPING`.
- The JWT signing key we've provided a definition for should also be injected into the container under the key `SECRET_KEY`.
- The container should be health-checked using the following command:
  ```bash
  curl -f http://localhost/api/v1/health/ || exit 1
  ```
- Configure logging in the container using the following code:
```python
    logging=ecs.AwsLogDriver(
       stream_prefix=f"{settings.PROJECT_NAME}-fargate",
       log_retention=logs.RetentionDays.ONE_WEEK,
    ),
```
depending on when you started the assignment, this may have already been done for you, however if it has not, you should add it yourself.

#### Fargate service

Tie the backend resources together by creating an `ecs_patterns.ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService`, which creates a Fargate service from your existing cluster and task definition with a load balancer in front of it.

Attach the domain name `api.yoctogram.SUNETID.infracourse.cloud` and the backend certificate you created in the network stack to the load balancer. Also, make sure to redirect all HTTP port 80 traffic to HTTPS port 443.

At this point, you should be done configuring the backend!

#### Cloudfront frontend deployment

We've included some code that uploads the frontend code in `web` to an S3 bucket for deployment. Here, you'll connect the bucket to Cloudfront to cache frontend resources close to users for faster access and better security. You'll need to configure two _behaviors_ for the Cloudfront distribution -- configurations that tell Cloudfront how to route different requests.

The first (default) behavior should use the S3 frontend bucket we've configured for you as the origin. Ensure that all requests made using unencrypted HTTP are upgraded to HTTPS. Ensure that when users load the Cloudfront distribution, they are directed to `index.html` by default.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Ensure the Cloudfront distribution has permissions to access the frontend S3 bucket! Otherwise, you may end up with hard-to-debug errors where your frontend only partially works.
{{< /callout >}}

The second behavior should intercept all requests made to the `/api/*` path and direct them to the backend service. For this, the origin should be configured as the HTTP origin `api.yoctogram.SUNETID.infracourse.cloud`, again redirecting all HTTP requests to HTTPS. Make sure to forward all HTTP headers and allow all HTTP methods.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Be careful what you cache here! Content that stays the same across users is a great target for caching, but caching content that diverges across users can cause functionality and security issues.
{{< /callout >}}

Lastly, attach the domain name `yoctogram.SUNETID.infracourse.cloud` and the frontend certificate to the Cloudfront distribution. Also, make sure to redirect all 404 (not found) errors to `index.html` with a 200 OK response code.

## Deploying to AWS

### Preparing frontend code

In the `web` directory of the Assignment 2 repository, make a file named `.env` and paste the following in:

```bash
VITE_PROD_API=https://yoctogram.SUNETID.infracourse.cloud
```

Then, run the following commands to set up the frontend code for deployment:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Synthesizing CDK resources

First, make and activate a Python virtual environment in the `cdk` directory of your Assignment 2 repository. Then, install the dependencies for the CDK project using `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This should now allow you to get started with the CDK deployment process.

First, synthesize your CDK definitions to a CloudFormation template. To do so, run the following command:

```
cdk synth
```

If your definitions are correct, this should not yield any errors. If this step completes successfully, you can then go ahead and deploy to AWS.

### Deploying DNS

The next step is to make your account ready for the deployment process. Run the following command:

```
cdk bootstrap
```

You'll first want to deploy the standalone DNS stack. To do so, run the following command:

```
cdk deploy yoctogram-dns-stack
```

Then, log into the AWS console and navigate to _Route 53_. Click on "Hosted Zones"; there should now be one entry for `SUNET.infracourse.cloud`. Click on this entry.

You should see a table with two rows, where one row contains entries of type `NS` and the other of type `SOA`. Locate the _NS_ record, and copy the four lines under the column "Value/Route traffic to".

![Screenshot indicating the NS records in Route 53](/assignments/2/find_nameservers.jpg "Screenshot indicating the NS records in Route 53")

Go to https://provisiondns.infracourse.cloud/ns. Log in with your Stanford Google account, and then paste the four lines you copied into the text box. Click submit.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The above DNS provisioner creates name server (NS) records on the parent zone `infracourse.cloud` (which is owned by the course staff) to _delegate_ the child zone `SUNETID.infracourse.cloud` to your provisioned AWS Route 53 hosted zone. This allows you to create any child records of `SUNETID.infracourse.cloud`, such as `example.SUNETID.infracourse.cloud`.
{{< /callout >}}

6. Take a few minutes to let the newly created records propagate. To verify if this was successful, you can visit https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/ in your browser and enter `SUNETID.infracourse.cloud` into the Name box, substituting `SUNETID` for your SUNet ID (i.e., Cody would write `codyho`) and click `NS`. If everything is correct, you should see the nameservers that were provisioned within the AWS console.

{{< callout type="error" >}}
If you're running this immediately after creating the record, _it is almost certain you will get an error_ about failing to resolve the name `SUNETID.infracourse.cloud` since the record hasn't had time to propagate. In this case, give it some time. Five minutes should be enough, but if it's still broken after an hour, there might be a mistake and you should re-check the records you pasted into the DNS Provisioner site. You must have DNS working for the next steps in this assignment.
{{< /callout >}}

### Deploying remaining resources

Now, you can simply run

```
cdk deploy --all
```

to deploy all remaining stacks to AWS.  This should take around 10 minutes, if  the deploy is still going after 20 minutes you likely made a mistake.

If everything worked properly, your own version of Yoctogram will now be deployed at `https://yoctogram.SUNETID.infracourse.cloud`!

If you need to conduct a teardown of the infrastructure you just provisioned, you can simply run `cdk destroy`, passing in one or more stack names.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Make sure you don't destroy the `yoctogram-dns-stack` stack, as this needs to be deployed separately and before other stacks.
{{< /callout >}}

## Debugging

If you encounter errors during deployment, look in the Event logs in the CloudFormation console.  If these logs are not sufficiently detailed, then look at the Event logs for the specific task of the specific AWS service.  If you do not have any logs, make sure you configured logging (without logs, debugging is nearly impossible).

## Submission and Grading

To submit your code, first create a file `SUNET` in the root of the assignment directory (that's the one with the subdirectories `app`, `cdk`, and `web`, as well as some other files) that contains _only your SUNet ID_. The file must be named `SUNET`. For example, Cody would create the following `SUNET`:

```
codyho
```

Commit and push this file to GitHub, then upload your submission to Gradescope from GitHub.

![Submitting the GitHub repository to Gradescope](/assignments/2/submission.png)

The point distribution for this assignment is as follows:

- 90 points: Static [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) evaluation against our OPA policies. This step verifies that the CloudFormation your CDK is synthesized to is compliant to our specification. All the tests are public in the `rules` directory and you are able to test this yourself using the `grade.sh` script.
- 40 points: Dynamic website interaction. We impersonate a real user, creating accounts and attempting to upload and view images. If you can open the site in a browser and are able to use it, you should get full points.
- 20 points: Verification that the website's appearance is as expected. If you can load `yoctogram.SUNETID.infracourse.cloud` in your browser, and everything looks correct (all the assets in the right place, CSS loads, etc) then you should get full points.

As always, you can submit as many times as you want until you're satisfied with your grade.
