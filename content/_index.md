# Cloud Infrastructure and Scalable Application Deployment

### Winter 2024

**Mondays & Wednesdays, 4:30 PM -- 5:50 PM** \
**[380-380W](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?srch=380-380W)**

Trying to launch your next viral programming project and anticipating substantial user growth? This course will help you learn to implement your ideas in the cloud in a scalable, cost-effective manner. Topics will include cloud AI/ML pipelines, virtual machines, containers, basic networking, expressing infrastructure as code (IaC), data management, security and observability, and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). Through hands-on learning and practical examples, you'll learn to effectively deploy and manage cloud infrastructure. There is no out-of-pocket cost associated with this class and cloud credits will be provided for all students.

## Course Info

### Course Structure

CS 40 is a 3-unit course that meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 4:30pm to 5:50pm. Students will be assessed based on completion of in-class activities as well as based on homework assignments that directly relate to that weekâ€™s topic and an open-ended final project. There are no exams.

### Prerequisites

* Programming maturity up to CS 107
* Familiarity with the command line, version control, and basic development tools to the level of CS 45/CS 104, in particular:
  - Basic Unix command line utilities and administration
  - Editing code with a TUI editor such as `vim`, `emacs`, or `nano`
  - Using Git and GitHub for collaborative projects (i.e. branching and pull requests)
  - Basic familiarity with package managers for languages and operating systems (e.g., `pip`, `apt`, `homebrew`)
  - Prior web development or networking experience helpful but not required

Please talk to us if you have any questions about your readiness for this class.
