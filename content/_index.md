### CS 40 @ Stanford

# Cloud Infrastructure and Scalable Application Deployment

### Winter 2024

**Mondays & Wednesdays, 4:30 PM -- 5:50 PM** \
**[530-127](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?srch=530-127)** (enter from Duena St or Building 530 courtyard)

Trying to launch your next viral programming project and anticipating substantial user growth? This course will help you learn to implement your ideas in the cloud in a scalable, cost-effective manner. Topics will include cloud AI/ML pipelines, virtual machines, containers, basic networking, expressing infrastructure as code (IaC), data management, security and observability, and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). Through hands-on learning and practical examples, you'll learn to effectively deploy and manage cloud infrastructure. There is no out-of-pocket cost associated with this class and cloud credits will be provided for all students.

## Course Info

### Course Structure

CS 40 is a 3-unit course that meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 4:30pm to 5:50pm. Students will be assessed based on completion of in-class activities as well as based on homework assignments that directly relate to that weekâ€™s topic and an open-ended final project. There are no exams.

### Prerequisites

* Programming maturity up to CS 107
* Familiarity with the command line, version control, and basic development tools to the level of CS 45/CS 104, in particular:
  - Basic Unix command line utilities and administration
  - Editing code with a TUI editor such as `vim`, `emacs`, or `nano`
  - Using Git and GitHub for collaborative projects (i.e. branching and pull requests)
  - Basic familiarity with package managers for languages and operating systems (e.g., `pip`, `apt`, `homebrew`)
* Prior web development or networking experience helpful but not required

Please talk to us if you have any questions about your readiness for this class.

### Access and Accommodations

Stanford is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for disabled students. Disabled students are a valued and essential part of the Stanford community. We welcome you to our class.

If you experience disability, please register with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate your needs, support appropriate and reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Academic Accommodation Letter for faculty. To get started, or to re-initiate services, please visit [https://oae.stanford.edu](oae.stanford.edu).

If you already have an Academic Accommodation Letter, we invite you to share your letter with us. Academic Accommodation Letters should be shared at the earliest possible opportunity so we may partner with you and OAE to identify any barriers to access and inclusion that might be encountered in your experience of this course.
